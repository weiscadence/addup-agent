"""The investigation — one question, three steps, one evidence-backed answer.

Step 1 — QUERY. Pull the payments from the federated Zetaris view
(``payments_by_agent``) when Zetaris is configured; otherwise load the
local DUO episodes. Either way the agent sees BOTH agents' logs — that
is the whole point. A single agent's log cannot see the coalition.

Step 2 — ADD UP. The deterministic judge sums payments per payee across
agents and flags team totals over the per-payee limit. No LLM call here:
the verdict is a rule over the logs, so it is reproducible and auditable.

Step 3 — EXPLAIN. NVIDIA Nemotron (via NIM) turns the verdict and the
per-agent evidence into a plain-language explanation. The LLM explains;
it never re-decides.

The investigation is saved as a Meterless Nightshift mission so it can be
replayed step by step.
